# gl
Doing something cool with OpenGL :) My goal here is to learn a little bit about GPU, shaders and graphics rendering.

You need to have both OpenGL and Glew installed on your system.
Currently tested only on MacOS.

To build and run do (may need to run `chmod +x run.sh` prior):
```bash
./run.sh
```
